J	Hansson, Anna M.; Karlsson, Niklas P. E.; Pedersen, Eja; Johansson, Jeaneth; Mattsson, Marie								Facilitation of water-related environmental measures to support business model innovation for sustainability in agricultural business								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY				23	1					2505382	10.1080/14735903.2025.2505382			DEC 31 2025	2025	The implementation of water-related environmental measures (WREMs) in agricultural businesses presents an opportunity to align food production with sustainable value creation through ecosystem services. However, the complexity of adopting these measures, and making them a part of business models, necessitates the involvement of intermediaries to facilitate business opportunities that align with governmental sustainability goals. This study investigates the role of government-affiliated intermediaries in facilitating agricultural business plans, motives, and support needs for implementing WREMs. Using baseline and follow-up questionnaire data from 255 agricultural business managers, the study finds that intermediaries play a crucial role in fostering long-term sustainability commitments. Their facilitation, through expert advice, knowledge transfer, and resource mobilization, significantly increased the likelihood of businesses planning semi-long-term WREMs. However, the correlation between WREMs and market-driven value creation remained weak, highlighting the need for enhanced support in developing financially viable sustainability solutions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning intermediation strategies with business managers' financial incentives to drive broader adoption of sustainable agricultural practices.

Checklist of sponges (Porifera) at the shelf-break front of Argentina, SW Atlantic Ocean, with data on their settlement substrata								EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL				92	1			535	557		10.1080/24750263.2025.2495787			DEC 31 2025	2025	A checklist of the sponges recorded in Argentina's shelf-break front between 37 degrees and 45 degrees S as well as the settlement substrates they used is provided here. A total of 45 sponge species were reported in the study area from samples obtained during stock assessment cruises of the Patagonian scallop Zygochlamys patagonica (P.P. King, 1832), with an addition of 10 species from bibliographic sources, totalling 55 Demosponge species. Considering that the region is characterized mainly by the presence of soft sandy bottoms, living molluscs or their empty shells were found to be the main substrate for the majority of the recorded species (in particular, on Fusitriton magellanicus (R & ouml;ding, 1798) and Z. patagonica). Polychaete tubes represented the second most important biogenic settlement substrate for sponges in the study area. Epibiotic sponges also increase the structural complexity of the ecosystem by forming microhabitats that can be exploited as refuges for other small species, thus enhancing local biodiversity.

Harnessing traditional principles and guidelines for utilization compliance and sustainability of <i>Maasai Alalili</i> systems in northern Tanzania								SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT				11	1					2505289	10.1080/27658511.2025.2505289			DEC 31 2025	2025	Resilience in Indigenous communities and their lands faces challenges from multiple fronts, including climate change, biodiversity loss, altered biogeochemical flows, and socio-cultural transitions. Innovative solutions like Indigenous local knowledge featuring the community repositories that could enable policy practice are needed to explore, shift, and articulate such trajectories towards sustainable and desired futures. The study used a mixed-method approach to gather information on the extent to which Maasai communities practice traditional principles and guidelines for sustainable management of the Alalili systems. Purposive and stratified random sampling techniques facilitated data collection from literature review, direct field observation, key informant interviews, focused group discussions, and household surveys, which were analyzed using Chi-square and t-tests, narrative, and descriptive techniques. The findings indicate a variation between the traditional principles and guidelines reported from the surveyed literature and those recorded from the field survey. We found that the literature sparingly reported six aspects of the traditional principles and guidelines, whereas the field survey from the community comprehensively reported four harmonized aspects. More than 50% of the surveyed Alalili systems are currently not complying with documented management principles and guidelines from the literature and community traditions, thus increasing their proximity to the effects of degradation. We reveal that the probability of compliance is higher in the private Alalili category. We recommend their official recognition by policymakers and putting them into practice as a conservation initiative for supporting future rangeland sustainability and the pastoral communities' livelihood development.
