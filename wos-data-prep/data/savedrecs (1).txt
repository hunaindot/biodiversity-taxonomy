J	Kembo, Tinotenda Rosemary; Utete, Beaven								Local ecological knowledge (LEK) reveals the drivers and barriers for sustainable conservation of protected forest biodiversity								SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT				11	1					2505338	10.1080/27658511.2025.2505338			DEC 31 2025	2025	Understanding the key drivers and barriers to sustainable conservation of protected and unprotected forests, heavily utilised by humans and wildlife, is essential in sustainable forest management and law enforcement. This study aimed to: i) evaluate fringe community perceptions towards forest biodiversity sustainability across villages; ii) establish the key drivers and barriers of biodiversity conservation, and iii) develop an integrated conservation framework for the Gwaai Forest in Zimbabwe. Data were collected from 143 respondents using questionnaires, key informant interviews and direct observations. Locals, simultaneously, preferred and exerted negative pressure on clusterleaf Terminalia sericea and African teak Baikea plurijuga for carving, roofing and furniture making increasing the distance travelled to collect forest products. Human population increase, poaching, veld fires and overexploitation were the key barriers whereas tangible and intangible benefits for local people and improved management systems were the key drivers of sustainable conservation. Gwaai Forest access and utilisation is heavily regulated by the forest authorities whose policies are not human centred but rather aimed at maintaining the resilience and stability of the forest. There is a need to explore suitable alternative livelihoods such as farming of drought resistant small grains less dependent on the Gwaai Forest ecosystem services to reduce pressure on tree species and other natural resources. An in-depth understanding of the ecological, economic, and social factors that influence forest resilience is necessary for planning and managing Gwaai Forest operations efficiently.

Taxonomy and molecular systematic position of the freshwater genus <i>Eunapius</i> with the descriptions of new species: more evidence in favour of the polyphyly of Spongillida								SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY				23	1					2491350	10.1080/14772000.2025.2491350			DEC 31 2025	2025	Eunapius is one of the most diverse genera in Spongillida with 17 species currently accepted. So far, only two records of this genus are known from Mexico: Eunapius fragilis from Xochimilco cited as Spongilla fragilis (by Rioja) and Spongilla fragilis var. zempoalensis from Zempoala lagoon (by Rioja). We revised Rioja's original material, and new material from Zempoala lakes and considered that these records must be proposed as new species: Spongilla fragilis from Xochimilco is described as Eunapius xochimilca new sp., and Spongilla fragilis var zempoalensis is described as E. zempoalensis new comb. In addition, we described two new species, E. gamundii and E. acanthostrongylae new spp. The main morphological characteristics that define these new species focus on the oxeas and gemmuloscleres morphology and size, as well as the shape and size of the gemmules. Their morphological differences are also supported by nuclear-ribosomal molecular markers, specifically the ITS region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), which were used to assess the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Eunapius. Tree topology showed genus Eunapius in a monophyletic clade composed of three main groups, which were clustered together with other genera of the family Spongillidae. Our results also support the previous molecular hypothesis, which suggests the polyphyly of Spongillidae and the need to reevaluate the taxonomy at the family level. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:68BE6873-A44B-4D58-A990-55DA430D52B0		[Carballo, J.

Several short-term intervention trials by A. soehngenii L2-7 have shown improvement of insulin sensitivity in prediabetic subjects and type 2 diabetes patients. To determine the long-term cardiometabolic benefits and safety, we performed a 3-month double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled intervention in 98 prediabetic insulin-resistant adults in Europe and U.S. with daily administration of encapsulated cells of A. soehngenii CH-106, a tetracycline-sensitive isogenic derivative of strain L2-7. Compared to placebo, A. soehngenii-treated subjects showed significantly reduced glycemic variability (1% reduction in the coefficient of variation; p = 0.01) and improved glycemic control (6% reduction in the overall net glycemic action-1; p < 0.05), including reduced serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels when including the 4-week washout period (1 mmol/mol reduction; p < 0.05). Moreover, diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in all A. soehngenii-treated subjects (3 mm Hg; p < 0.05). The study product was well-tolerated and had no effect on the global intestinal microbiota composition, including alpha and beta-diversity, besides an increased abundance of A. soehngenii in the treatment group, indicative of compliance. The U.S. participants, compared to those in Europe, responded best, notably in the oral glucose tolerance tests (15% improvement in the area-under-the curve of plasma glucose levels; p = 0.039) or coefficient of variation (reduction of 3.1%; p < 0.05). This potentially relates to a more severe prediabetic state in U.S. subjects, associated with significantly reduced (1.5-3.5-fold) relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus spp. and two-fold increased relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium spp. In conclusion, daily oral supplementation with A. soehngenii was safe and improved various markers of glycemic control, reduced HbA1c levels and diastolic blood pressure, indicating a novel microbiome-based approach to improve cardio-metabolic health in adults at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.
